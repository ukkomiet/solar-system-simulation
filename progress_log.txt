Hello, this is where I'll be hopefully keeping log of my progress.

I've had to start a new project because I forgot to include sbt into the earlier version.
I decided to delete that project and create a new identical one with the inclusion of sbt of course.



I've done the major classes and included some important methods. In the next few coming days I'll finish the rest of the needed methods for calculations and
then I'll implement a simple GUI to test my overall results better.

This is how I've planned the system to go:

These following things are done each timeStep until the time-variable reaches a certain value:

-> updateGravities
-> calculate the total force for body -> updateDirection
-> calculate the acceleration for body -> velocity = velocity + acceleration*timeStep
-> updatePosition
-> time = time + timeStep
-> Repeat until time reaches ceiling



4.4     All things above added except the GUI

  Now I'm working on the simple GUI to produce test-systems and after I've fixed every problem that has arisen I'll move onto finding
  a good 3D plotting system GUI library or something. Looking into that stuff afterwards.

  Unfortunately I've been rather busy with other school work and exams, so I've not had the time to continue the progress further. Though after exams I'll have more time to really push forward
